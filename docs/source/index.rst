Arm Demos is a ROS 2 project to demonstrate the capabilities of the UR3e robotic arm.
The goal of this project is to have fun, safe, and interactive robotics demonstrations, as well as to provide a working baseline for future development with the UR3e.

Features
--------

* Robot motion planning with inverse kinematics and collision avoidance using MoveIt, TRAC-IK, and OMPL.
* Human hand motion and gesture imitation using Google MediaPipe Hand Landmarker and OpenCV.

Libraries
---------

* ROS 2: Node system for programming robots
* MoveIt 2 (TRAC-IK, OMPL): Motion planning
* DepthAI SDK: Camera streaming
* Google MediaPipe Hand Landmarker: Hand video to joint coordinates
* OpenCV: Camera stream and landmark view

Requirements
------------

* A host computer.
* A Universal Robots UR3e robotic arm, connected with ethernet.
* A Luxonis OAK-D Pro camera, connected with high-speed USB3.
